#### Storage Manager 
Due to the proprietary data for this project I am unable to share documentation or architecture relating to the project 
- created SM, which was created to manage very sensitive Tax data 
- accomplished using a proprietary cloud agnostic architecture using multiple services 
- created the Tax application which used tokens generated by the storage manager to access sensitive data and automate tax pipelines which were done manually in the past
- the creation of the storage manager and the automated pipelines ran through the tax application allowed the Tax team to increase efficiency of their team by 25%
