## AEG: Ticketing Application
Anschutz Entertainment Group, one of the largest entertainment companies in the world needed a new Ticket Reporting Application to track their international ticket sales in real time. 

#### Complex issues on this project 

#### Architecture 

#### ETL
AEG does over $25mm in Ticket sales annually from multiple different ticket vendors. 

To make sense of all this disparate data I had to first decide on a standardized format to store the data in our applications BE, this required investigation and defining the raw tables we were ingesting then standardizing how they would be saved on our back end. (Refer to Steps 1-3 of ETL Documentation)   

#### Notifications

### EY
#### Storage Manager 
Due to the proprietary data for this project I am unable to share documentation or architecture relating to the project 
- created SM, which was created to manage very sensitive Tax data 
- accomplished using a proprietary cloud agnostic architecture using multiple services 
- created the Tax application which used tokens generated by the storage manager to access sensitive data and automate tax pipelines which were done manually in the past
- the creation of the storage manager and the automated pipelines ran through the tax application allowed the Tax team to increase efficiency of their team by 25%

### NFL 
#### Fantasy Football Data Analysis Project
